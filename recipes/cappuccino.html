        <li>Place the milk in a pitcher. Hold the steaming wand just below the surface of the milk until it doubles in size and is very foamy. Lower the steaming wand slightly until the milk reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit (use a thermometer or judge by when your hand canâ€™t hold the pitcher for more than a few seconds).</li>
